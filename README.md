# Smart Home Skill Sample: Send Change Report (Python)

## Overview
This project shows you how to set up your Smart Home skill to send change reports to the Alexa Event Gateway. A change report is a type of event that is sent to Alexa when a device changes state (e.g. a user physically turns off a smart switch). Alexa needs to know the current device state in order to provide accurate information to the user.

When you're ready to look at the code, go to the [instructions](src/instructions.md) to get started.
